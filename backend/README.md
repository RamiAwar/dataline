# Dataline Backend

## Installation

Make sure you have poetry installed from their official website.
If you have multiple python versions, do: `poetry env use python3.11`.
We're going with 3.11 for now cause of all the nice features.

```
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry install
```

## Current state

They stay if you ship something you're proud of, you've shipped too late.

- Currently some raw SQL from the very early MVP remains and is being replaced with SQLAlchemy queries.
- The LLM querying code is also pretty non-generic and hard to extend, so that will soon be replaced with some "Agent" implementation.

### pre-commit

```
pre-commit install
```

## Running the backend

Make sure you have an OpenAI key in your environment variables.
`export OPENAI_API_KEY=...`

Run migrations if needed:

```
python -m alembic upgrade head
```

You can then run uvicorn to start the backend:

```
uvicorn dataline.main:app --reload --port=7377
```

To run tests: `PYTHONPATH=. pytest . -vv`
