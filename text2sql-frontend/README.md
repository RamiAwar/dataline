## Overview
We use React + Typescript + Tailwindcss. For UI and design, we try to stick to TailwindUI components as much as possible, and HeroIcons for icons.

Rest should be self-explanatory!

## Installation
`npm install`

## Building

Something to keep in mind is having a .env.sentry-build-plugin file with the SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN variable to send sourcemaps to sentry.

## Running
You should make sure the backend is running for this part (port 7377).

```
export NODE_ENV=local
npm run dev
```

DON'T Install and start supabase on Mac (https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started?platform=macos):
```
brew install supabase/tap/supabase
supabase init
supabase start
```

## Tauri
Will come later. Not working perfectly yet, not a certain need either.
